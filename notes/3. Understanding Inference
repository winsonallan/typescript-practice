When do we use annotations or inference?

Annotations: 
  - When a function returns the 'any' type and we need to clarify the value
  - When we declare a variable on one line then initialize it later
  - When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
  

- The type 'any' means TS has no idea what this is -> Can't check for correct property references.

- Avoid variables with 'any' at all costs
