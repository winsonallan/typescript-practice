Output Build Files to Different folder
======================================
1. Generate config file => tsc.init
2. Open the generated tsconfig.json file, search for rootdir and outdir
3. Configure rootdir to your typescript code folder
4. Configure outdir to your desired build output folder
5. Run command 'tsc' (or 'tsc -w' if you want to enable automatic building as we change the typescript code)
6. Run 'node [js file directory]' to run the built js files.
7. If you don't want to re-run the node command every time, do these:
  7a) npm init -y
  7b) npm install nodemon concurrently
  7c) Open package.json and in the 'scripts' section add these:
    - "start:build": "tsc -w",
    - "start:run": "nodemon build/index.js",
    - "start": "concurrently npm start:*"
  7d) npm start
